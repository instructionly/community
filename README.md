# Instructionly Community

Welcome to the official community space for [Instructionly](https://instructionly.io) - the AI instruction platform.

## What is Instructionly?

Instructionly delivers your rules and instructions to any AI tool via MCP integration. Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, Windsurf, and more.

## Meet ion

ion is our mascot, our logo, and the command that brings your instructions to life. Just like ions connect atoms to form molecules, ion connects your knowledge to AI.

When you say `ion` to your AI assistant, you're activating Instructionly:

```
ion, please write a blog post about productivity tips
```
